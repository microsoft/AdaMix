## Fine-tuning Wav2Vec2

The `run_training.py` script allows one to finetune pretrained Wav2Vec2 models that can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=facebook/wav2vec2).

This finetuning script can also be run as a google colab [TODO: here]( ).

The script is actively maintained by [Patrick von Platen](https://github.com/patrickvonplaten). 
Feel free to ask a question on the [Forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/) or post an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/new/choose) and adding `@patrickvonplaten` as a tag.
